<p>
The abrupt shift happened on September 4, 1979, less than five years before we graduated.
After 115 years, Iolani let in girls.  Although the class of 1983 was the first official 
graduating class with 41 girls let into their 9th grade class, 
our class shared the same problems in adapting to a 
new culture, academically and socially.  
</p>
<p>  The girls were drastically out-numbered by boys.
Along with the 41 girls in 9th grade, 46 girls
were let into 7th grade, making for a total of 87 girls integrated with nearly 900 boys in 
Upper School.
</p>
<p>
Comments from alumni of the class of 1984 show some of the growing pains 
the school experienced during this time.  With the larger pool of applicants
to choose from, the selection process got tougher.  Many of the boys 
that had been at Iolani for years were intimidated by the new girls
that were not only brilliant, but also mentally tough.
</p>
<p>
It wasn't just that the boys and girls had to learn to deal with each other
socially.  
The new girls brought increased academic competition.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> It's now, decades later, that I appreciate what Iolani did for me.  
    At the time, it was tough academically.  Maybe I appreciate it more now because I have kids.</li>
  <li> It was tough-love, not even sure if I would call it love.  It was tough nuturing, but 
    still nuturing, just in a stressful and at time fear-inducing way.</li>
  <li> We would have probably benefitted from counseling how to to interact with girls.  Many
    of the guys were sons of Iolani and hadn't been in a class with girls before. </li>
  <li> Everyone was trying to fit in.  It was tough for everyone.  No one cruised, not even
  the students that got over 4.0 GPAs.  Everyone worked.  It was part of culture.</li>
</ul>
